# Gemstone Price Prediction: Diamond Price Predictor

## 🌟 Introduction

**Diamond Price Prediction** is a powerful machine learning project aimed at predicting the **price of a diamond** based on its characteristics. By leveraging the relationship between various attributes of diamonds and their prices, we can build a highly accurate model that serves as an indispensable tool for jewelers, appraisers, and buyers. This project uses **regression analysis** techniques to predict the price of a diamond, offering both practical applications and valuable insights into the diamond market.

### 📊 Data Description:

The dataset consists of multiple features that describe the diamond’s physical and quality characteristics. These features are used to estimate the diamond's **price**, which is the target variable in this regression task.

#### **Independent Variables:**
1. **id**: A unique identifier for each diamond (used for reference, not for prediction).
2. **carat**: The weight of the diamond (measured in carats). Carat is one of the most influential factors affecting a diamond's price.
3. **cut**: The quality of the diamond's cut. The cut determines how well the diamond interacts with light, and it impacts its brilliance and overall visual appeal.
   - Categories: Fair, Good, Very Good, Ideal, Excellent
4. **color**: The color grade of the diamond, ranging from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown). A higher color grade generally means a higher price.
   - Categories: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, ..., Z
5. **clarity**: Clarity represents the presence of imperfections (inclusions and blemishes). A flawless diamond is worth significantly more.
   - Categories: Flawless, Internally Flawless, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3
6. **depth**: The depth of the diamond, measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (top surface). This influences the diamond's proportions and light reflection.
7. **table**: The width of the diamond's table (the flat top surface) as a percentage of its overall diameter.
8. **x**: The length of the diamond (in millimeters).
9. **y**: The width of the diamond (in millimeters).
10. **z**: The height of the diamond (in millimeters).

#### **Target Variable:**
- **price**: The market price of the diamond in USD.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Before training a machine learning model, we need to preprocess the data:

1. **Handling Missing Data**: Some rows might contain missing values that need to be filled or dropped.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: We will encode categorical features like `cut`, `color`, and `clarity` using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Features such as `carat`, `depth`, `table`, `x`, `y`, and `z` may require scaling to ensure they are in a comparable range for machine learning algorithms.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Optionally, we can create new features, such as calculating the volume of the diamond (`volume = x * y * z`), to provide more context to the model.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

The next step is to train machine learning models on the preprocessed data. We can experiment with various algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple but effective algorithm for regression tasks.
- **Random Forest Regression**: A robust ensemble method that works well on complex datasets.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships well.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines**: Another boosting method that often outperforms traditional methods.

---

## 📏 Evaluation

We evaluate the model using common regression metrics such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the model's predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Gives more weight to large errors, making it useful for detecting large deviations.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## 🧠 Model Evaluation and Selection

In our quest to predict the price of diamonds with precision, we evaluated several regression models. Here's a summary of their performance:

| Model          | R² Score       |
|----------------|----------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.9363       |
| Lasso              | 0.9364       |
| Ridge             | 0.9363       |
| ElasticNet       | 0.8553       |

After rigorous testing and validation, **Lasso Regression** emerged as the best model for our task with an impressive R² score of **0.9364**.

### 🌟 Why Lasso Regression?

Lasso Regression stands out for its ability to perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, which helps in handling high-dimensional data. This property is particularly useful in our case as it simplifies the model without sacrificing accuracy, making it both efficient and interpretable.

---

### 📊 Model Insights

1. **Linear Regression**: A straightforward model that provides a good baseline with an R² score of 0.9363. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
2. **Lasso Regression**: Our top performer, Lasso Regression, not only predicts accurately but also eliminates irrelevant features, improving model interpretability.
3. **Ridge Regression**: Similar to Linear Regression, Ridge adds a penalty on the size of coefficients to prevent overfitting, achieving a comparable R² score of 0.9363.
4. **ElasticNet**: This model combines the properties of both Lasso and Ridge. Despite its flexibility, it scored lower with an R² of 0.8553, suggesting it may not be the best fit for our dataset.

### 🔍 Choosing the Best Model

Given the R² scores, **Lasso Regression** was selected as the best model, offering the highest accuracy while maintaining simplicity. Its ability to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection makes it a robust choice for predicting diamond prices.

### 📈 Next Steps

With our model chosen, the next steps include further fine-tuning and validation to ensure its robustness across different datasets. Additionally, we can explore deploying the model using a web application for real-time diamond price predictions.

Stay tuned for more updates on our journey to perfecting the art of diamond price prediction! 💎📊

## 🎯 Usage

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the price of diamonds based on the provided features. Users can input diamond attributes like `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, and the 3D dimensions (`x`, `y`, `z`) into the trained model to get an estimated price.

For example:
- A diamond with a 1.5 carat weight, "Ideal" cut, color "G", and clarity "VS1" could yield a predicted price of $6,500.
